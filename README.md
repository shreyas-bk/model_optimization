# Model Compression Toolkit (MCT)

Model Compression Toolkit (MCT) is an open-source project for neural network model optimization under efficient, constrained hardware.

This project provides researchers, developers, and engineers tools for optimizing and deploying state-of-the-art neural networks on efficient hardware.

Specifically, this project aims to apply quantization to compress neural networks.

## Supported Features

MCT supports different quantization methods:
* Post-training quantization (PTQ): [Keras API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/experimental_api_docs/methods/keras_post_training_quantization_experimental.html#ug-keras-post-training-quantization-experimental), [PyTorch API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/experimental_api_docs/methods/pytorch_post_training_quantization_experimental.html#ug-pytorch-post-training-quantization-experimental)
* Gradient-based post-training quantization (GPTQ): [Keras API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/experimental_api_docs/methods/keras_gradient_post_training_quantization_experimental.html#ug-keras-gradient-post-training-quantization-experimental), [PyTorch API](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/api/experimental_api_docs/methods/pytorch_gradient_post_training_quantization_experimental.html#ug-pytorch-gradient-post-training-quantization-experimental)
* Quantization aware training (QAT)[*](#experimental-features)


| Quantization Method | Complexity                                    | Computational Cost          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| PTQ                 | Low                                           | Low (order of minutes)      |
| GPTQ                | Mild (parameters fine-tuning using gradients) | Mild (order of 2-3 hours)   |
| QAT                 | High                                          | High (order of 12-36 hours) |


In addition, MCT supports different quantization schemes for quantizing weights and activations:
* Power-Of-Two (hardware-friendly quantization [1])
* Symmetric
* Uniform

Main features:
* <ins>Graph optimizations:</ins> Transforming the model to an equivalent (yet, more efficient) model (for example, batch-normalization layer folding to its preceding linear layer).
* <ins>Quantization parameter search:</ins> Different methods can be used to minimize the expected added quantization-noise during thresholds search (by default, we use Mean-Square-Error, but other metrics can be used such as No-Clipping, Mean-Average-Error, and more).
* <ins>Advanced quantization algorithms:</ins> To prevent a performance degradation some algorithms are applied such as: 
  * <ins>Shift negative correction:</ins> Symmetric activation quantization can hurt the model's performance when some layers output both negative and positive activations, but their range is asymmetric. For more details please visit [1].
  * <ins>Outliers filtering:</ins> Computing z-score for activation statistics to detect and remove outliers.
* <ins>Clustering:</ins> Using non-uniform quantization grid to quantize the weights and activations to match their distributions.[*](#experimental-features)
* <ins>Mixed-precision search:</ins> Assigning quantization bit-width per layer (for weights/activations), based on the layer's sensitivity to different bit-widths.
* <ins>Visualization:</ins> You can use TensorBoard to observe useful information for troubleshooting the quantized model's performance (for example, the model in different phases of the quantization, collected statistics, similarity between layers of the float and quantized model and bit-width configuration for mixed-precision quantization). For more details, please read the [visualization documentation](https://sony.github.io/model_optimization/docs/guidelines/visualization.html).   
* <ins>Target Platform Capabilities:</ins> The Target Platform Capabilities (TPC) describes the target platform (an edge device with dedicated hardware). For more details, please read the [TPC README](model_compression_toolkit/target_platform_capabilities/README.md).
