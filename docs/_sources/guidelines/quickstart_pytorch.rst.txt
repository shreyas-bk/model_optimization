MCT Quickstart Guideline for Pytorch models
=================================================

Here is an example of a code that shows how to use MCT with Pytorch models.


Import MCT and mobilenet_v2 from torchvision.models:

.. code-block:: python

    from torchvision.models import mobilenet_v2
    import model_compression_toolkit as mct

|

Data preprocessing imports and functions:

.. code-block:: python

    from PIL import Image
    from torchvision import transforms

    def np_to_pil(img):
        return Image.fromarray(img)

|

Initialize data loader:

.. code-block:: python

    # Set the batch size of the images at each calibration iteration.
    batch_size = 50

    # Set the path to the folder of images to load and use for the representative dataset.
    # Notice that the folder have to contain at least one image.
    folder = '/path/to/images/folder'

    # Create a representative data generator, which returns a list of images.
    # The images can be preprocessed using a list of preprocessing functions.
    from model_compression_toolkit import FolderImageLoader

    image_data_loader = FolderImageLoader(folder,
                                          preprocessing=[np_to_pil,
                                                         transforms.Compose([
                                                             transforms.Resize(256),
                                                             transforms.CenterCrop(224),
                                                             transforms.ToTensor(),
                                                             transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                                                                                  std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
                                                         ])
                                                         ],
                                          batch_size=batch_size)

    # Create a Callable representative dataset for calibration purposes.
    # The function should be called without any arguments, and should return a list numpy arrays (array for each
    # model's input).
    # For example: A model has two input tensors - one with input shape of [3 X 32 X 32] and the second with
    # an input shape of [3 X 224 X 224]. We calibrate the model using batches of 50 images.
    # Calling representative_data_gen() should return a list
    # of two numpy.ndarray objects where the arrays' shapes are [(50, 3, 32, 32), (50, 3, 224, 224)].
    n_iter = 20
    def representative_data_gen() -> list:
        for _ in range(n_iter):
            yield [image_data_loader.sample()]

Get a TargetPlatformCapabilities:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get a TargetPlatformModel object that models the hardware for the quantized model inference.
    # The model determines the quantization methods to use during the MCT optimization process.
    # Here, for example, we use the default model that is attached to a Pytorch
    # layers representation.
    target_platform_cap = mct.get_target_platform_capabilities('pytorch', 'default')

Run Post Training Quantization:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a model and quantize it using the representative_data_gen as the calibration images.
    # Set the number of calibration iterations to 20.
    model = mobilenet_v2(pretrained=True)

    # set core configuration with z threshold=16 (an algorithm for outlier removal)
    core_config = mct.core.CoreConfig(quantization_config=QuantizationConfig(z_threshold=16)

    # run post training quantization on the model to get the quantized model output
    quantized_model, quantization_info = mct.ptq.pytorch_post_training_quantization_experimental(model,
                                                                                             representative_data_gen,
                                                                                             core_config=core_config,
                                                                                             target_platform_capabilities=target_platform_cap)
